# AI Engineer x Kudwa Take-Home Test

Build an intelligent financial data processing system that demonstrates your expertise in AI/ML integration, backend architecture, and API design. This challenge focuses on PRACTICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING and ARCHITECTURAL THINKING with strong emphasis on AI capabilities.

## üß™¬†**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

You'll integrate diverse financial data sources into a unified backend system and enrich it with powerful AI capabilities. This directly reflects one of Kudwa's core technical challenges: integrating diverse financial data sources into a coherent and reliable single source of truth, enhanced with intelligent AI-powered insights.

## üèÖ¬†THE CHALLENGE

Design and implement a system that can:

1. INTEGRATE financial data from both provided sources
2. PROCESS and validate financial data with intelligent error handling
3. EXPOSE clean APIs for data access and analysis
4. PROVIDE AI-powered insights and natural language interactions

## üóíÔ∏è¬†**CORE REQUIREMENTS**

1. **Backend Architecture (Simplified for AI Focus)**

- Framework: Your choice (FastAPI)
- Database: Simple setup (SQLite acceptable)
- Data Integration: Focus on parsing and basic transformation
- API Design: RESTful endpoints

1. **AI Integration (A is mandatory; B is optional)**

**A. Natural Language Querying**

- Enable users to query financial data naturally through API endpoints.
- Integrate backend logic with LLM to interpret queries, fetch relevant data, and present clear answers
- Generate concise, insightful narratives from the integrated data, with clear answers and supporting data
- Handle follow-up questions and context-aware conversations
- Question examples:
    - "What was the total profit in Q1?"
    - "Show me revenue trends for 2024"
    - "Which expense category had the highest increase this year?"
    - "Compare Q1 and Q2 performance"
- Output Examples:
    - "Revenue increased by 10% in Q2, primarily driven by strong sales growth"
    - "Operating expenses rose 15% due to increased payroll and office costs"
    - "Cash flow improved significantly with better collection rates"
    - "Seasonal patterns show December revenue peaks at 180% of monthly average"

*Optional: log reasoning traces, tool calls, etc.*

**B. AI Analytics (great to have but not mandatory, choose one)**

- Comparative analysis across time periods
- Anomaly detection in financial patterns
- Revenue/expense forecasting and trend analysis
- Financial health scoring and risk assessment

*Note: keep it simple. A full fledged tool like the above would take too much time.*

1. **Data Processing (Focused on AI Preparation)**
- Parse both JSON data formats into a workable structure
- Basic data validation and quality checks
- Handle missing/inconsistent data intelligently
- Prepare data for AI analysis and querying

1. **Technical Quality**
- Clean Architecture: Well-structured, maintainable code
- Documentation: 1-2 pages technical report summarizing design decisions
- Error Handling: Focus on AI component reliability

## üñäÔ∏è¬†ADDITIONAL DETAIL

**API ENDPOINTS DESIGN**

Design clean RESTful endpoints that support the required AI features. Focus on practical implementation over detailed specification.

## üìí¬†DELIVERABLES

1. **Working AI-Powered Backend System**
- Complete API with natural language query support
- Natural language financial insights/summaries generation
- Advanced analytics features (optional)

1. **Code Repository with README**
- Clean, well-organized codebase
- Clear `README.md` with:
    - Setup instructions
    - Database initialization steps
    - API usage (if relevant)
- **Makefile** for simplified setup and common tasks (optional)

1. **Technical Documentation**
- 1-2 pages technical report summarizing design decisions. Examples of possible sections:
    - Project overview and architecture
    - Technology stack and rationale (especially AI/LLM choices)
    - Setup and installation instructions
    - AI/ML approach explanation and model choices
    - Known issues and limitations

1. **Demo Friendly System**
- DEPLOYED APIs or easy local setup (you can also use [render.com](http://render.com) for free deployments)
- Working endpoints demonstrable via API calls

**DEPLOYMENT EXPECTATIONS**

We highly value:

- Deployed APIs accessible via URL with live documentation
- Clear instructions for local development setup

## üèÜ¬†**SUCCESS TIPS**

- AI First: Focus your energy on making the AI features exceptional
- Start with One Source: Get QuickBooks data working perfectly, then add Rootfi
- Document AI Decisions: Especially your LLM integration and model choices
- Test AI Thoroughly: Include edge cases and error scenarios for AI components
- Be Deployment Ready: Shows production-ready thinking
- Focus on Value: Make your AI features as real-life as possible
